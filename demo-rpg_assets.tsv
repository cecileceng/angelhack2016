introduction	load	Welcome to Alexa Adventures. When you are ready, say "let's play". 	
introduction	let's-play	You received a text message from your business partner Burt Wordsworth earlier this evening. He seemed distressed and asked you to meet him at a nearby hotel at midnight. His friend Henry runs the bar, and says to tell him that Birdie sent you.'... 	nextscene_hotel_bar_1a
hotel_bar_1a	load	You are in a dimly lit hotel bar.
hotel_bar_1a	examine-bar	It's a typical hotel bar. The smell of cigarettes is pervasive and the tables and counters are sticky from spilled drinks. 	
hotel_bar_1a	examine-bartender	A tall gentleman stands behind the bar. His indifference towards you, his job and the world is very apparent as he stares blankly at nothing while wearing a permanent scowl on his face. 	
hotel_bar_1a	talk to-bartender	You approach the bartender. You tell him Birdie sent you, at which his eyes widen. He moves out from behind the bar to close the doors to the room, flipping the Open sign over to Closed. He pulls up  a barstool next to you. ‘I’ve known Birdie for a long time… never seen him like this. He was talking so fast I couldn’t barely understand what was happening. He kept saying ‘They’re after me.’ But when I asked who was after him he said ‘Not someone. SomeTHING.’ He told me he was going to meet you here, but then he got this look on his face like he realized something terrible. He left in a hurry though. He said something about leaving it with Lottie. Poor guy. His wife Lottie passed not too long ago. They buried her over at Summerton Cemetery. I would say he’s just grief stricken, but I’m still worried about him.’ The previously gruff looking bartender shows a soft side to him. But it doesn’t last. You hear screams from the lobby and suddenly the doors fly open. A towering figure enters the room, blood dripping off its hands. But something is strange. It’s in the shape of a man, but he has scales. Henry grabs you and starts pushing you out the backdoor. ‘We have to go find Birdie!’ You both run out the door but the lizardman is in pursuit. 	nextscene_alleyway_2a
hotel_bar_1a	attack-bartender	Attacking someone out of nowhere is hardly ever a good plan. The bartender is stronger than he looks and promptly beats you up. He drags you through the kitchen to the back and leaves you bloodied and crying. You also peed your pants. You can never return to the hotel bar. 	nextscene_alleyway_2b
hotel_bar_1a	examine-glasses	They are just standard glasses. 	
hotel_bar_1a	pick up-glasses	The bartender glares at you when you place your hands upon the glass. If you need something just ask me, I'm right here, he says. 	
hotel_bar_1a	exit-room	You leave the bar from where you entered and are now in the hotel lobby. 	nextscene_hotel_lobby_3a
hotel_lobby_3a	load	You didn’t see Birdie in the bar so you stroll back into the lobby. The economy hasn’t been kind to this once opulent boutique hotel. Parts of the chandelier are missing, the floors are scuffed from years of neglect and the lobby is empty save for a most likely overworked, underpaid receptionist at the front desk. 	
hotel_lobby_3a	reload	You can... examine receptionist, examine front desk, talk to receptionist, examine floor, examine chandelier. 	
hotel_lobby_3a	examine-receptionist	The receptionist doesn’t take kindly to looking at her. You figured as someone in the customer service industry that it wouldn’t be unusual to approach her, but upon closer inspection something is off about the receptionist. You notice on her neck what looks to be scales. Her stare fills you with dread as you begin to back away from the front desk. She hasn’t quite caught on that you saw her disguise unraveling before you bolt out the door making your way to the Police Station. 	nextscene_police_station_6b
hotel_lobby_3a	talk to-receptionist	You ask the receptionist if you have any messages from Mr. Wordsworth.  At the mention of his name the receptionist's demeanor changes. Her eyes gives you chills and she stalks towards you. You see shimmering scales on her neck as she transforms into a lizard beast man.  You try to flee, but she is on you in an instant.  She tears you to shreds. 	nextscene_endgame
hotel_lobby_3a	examine-floor	The floors look like they could use a good buff.
