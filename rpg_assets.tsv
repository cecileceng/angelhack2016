introduction	load	Welcome to Alexa Adventures. When you are ready, say "let's play". 	
introduction	let's-play	It's nearly midnight. You received a text message from your business partner Burt Wordsworth earlier this evening. He's not typically the type to message late at night. Burt has since been unresponsive with your calls and text messages. You glance down at your phone to look at the time and the last message you received… ‘The dark visions have been increasing… I know it sounds crazy, but I think we're in danger. Not just us but everyone. I can't stay here. Meet me at the hotel at midnight. My friend Henry runs the bar, tell him that Birdie sent you. I hope we're not too late to stop it...' 	nextscene_hotel_bar_1a
hotel_bar_1a	load	You are in a dimly lit hotel bar. It's near closing time, so it's empty aside from the bartender polishing the last of the glasses from the evening's crowd. 	
hotel_bar_1a	reload	You can... examine bar, examine bartender, talk to bartender, attack bartender, examine glasses, pick up glasses, exit room. 	
hotel_bar_1a	examine-bar	It's a typical hotel bar. The smell of cigarettes is pervasive and the tables and counters are sticky from spilled drinks. 	
hotel_bar_1a	examine-bartender	A tall gentleman stands behind the bar. His indifference towards you, his job and the world is very apparent as he stares blankly at nothing while wearing a permanent scowl on his face. 	
hotel_bar_1a	talk to-bartender	You approach the bartender. He eyes you suspiciously. You ask him if his name is Henry. He gruffly responds ‘Look pal, we’re about to close up shop here. I’m Henry, so what’s it to you?’ You tell him Birdie sent you, at which his eyes widen. He moves out from behind the bar to close the doors to the room, flipping the Open sign over to Closed. He pulls up  a barstool next to you. ‘I’ve known Birdie for a long time… never seen him like this. He was talking so fast I couldn’t barely understand what was happening. He kept saying ‘They’re after me.’ But when I asked who was after him he said ‘Not someone. SomeTHING.’ He told me he was going to meet you here, but then he got this look on his face like he realized something terrible. He left in a hurry though. He said something about leaving it with Lottie. Poor guy. His wife Lottie passed not too long ago. They buried her over at Summerton Cemetery. I would say he’s just grief stricken, but I’m still worried about him.’ The previously gruff looking bartender shows a soft side to him. But it doesn’t last. You hear screams from the lobby and suddenly the doors fly open. A towering figure enters the room, blood dripping off its hands. But something is strange. It’s in the shape of a man, but he has scales. Henry grabs you and starts pushing you out the backdoor. ‘We have to go find Birdie!’ You both run out the door but the lizardman is in pursuit. 	nextscene_alleyway_2a
hotel_bar_1a	attack-bartender	Attacking someone out of nowhere is hardly ever a good plan. The bartender is stronger than he looks and promptly beats you up. He drags you through the kitchen to the back and leaves you bloodied and crying. You also peed your pants. You can never return to the hotel bar. 	nextscene_alleyway_2b
hotel_bar_1a	examine-glasses	They are just standard glasses. 	
hotel_bar_1a	pick up-glasses	The bartender glares at you when you place your hands upon the glass. If you need something just ask me, I'm right here, he says. 	
hotel_bar_1a	exit-room	You leave the bar from where you entered and are now in the hotel lobby. 	nextscene_hotel_lobby_3a
hotel_lobby_3a	load	You didn’t see Birdie in the bar so you stroll back into the lobby. The economy hasn’t been kind to this once opulent boutique hotel. Parts of the chandelier are missing, the floors are scuffed from years of neglect and the lobby is empty save for a most likely overworked, underpaid receptionist at the front desk. 	
hotel_lobby_3a	reload	You can... examine receptionist, examine front desk, talk to receptionist, examine floor, examine chandelier. 	
hotel_lobby_3a	examine-receptionist	The receptionist doesn’t take kindly to looking at her. You figured as someone in the customer service industry that it wouldn’t be unusual to approach her, but upon closer inspection something is off about the receptionist. You notice on her neck what looks to be scales. Her stare fills you with dread as you begin to back away from the front desk. She hasn’t quite caught on that you saw her disguise unraveling before you bolt out the door making your way to the Police Station. 	nextscene_police_station_6b
hotel_lobby_3a	talk to-receptionist	You say hello to the receptionist and she is very curt with her response to you. “What?” You ask if any messages were left with the front desk by a Mr. Wordsworth. Just the mention of his name has suddenly piqued her interest and her demeanor completely changes. Something about the look in her eyes gives you chills and she starts stalking towards you. You notice on her neck what looks to be scales. At this point she makes a dive for you but you have already started bolting out of the door. Your first instinct is to take your findings to the Police Station. 	nextscene_police_station_6b
hotel_lobby_3a	examine-front desk	The front desk is unsurprisingly as disheveled as the rest of the hotel. The receptionist doesn’t take kindly to you nosing around the front desk area. You didn’t think it was a big deal, but upon closer inspection something is off about the receptionist. You notice on her neck what looks to be scales. Her stare fills you with dread as you begin to back away from the front desk. She hasn’t quite caught on that you saw her disguise unraveling before you bolt out the door making your way to the Police Station. 	nextscene_police_station_6b
hotel_lobby_3a	examine-chandelier	This chandelier was nice at one point, but not anymore. Some of the glass beads are missing, lights are burnt out and it’s covered with cobwebs. 	
hotel_lobby_3a	examine-floor	The floors look like they could use a good buff. 	
alleyway_2a	load	The alleyway is dark, and you narrowly avoid knocking over the trash cans lining the alleyway. Henry quickly hisses ‘Let’s split up. Whoever he follows keep him away from Lottie. Running out of the back alley behind the hotel you and Henry haul ass in opposite directions. Which way do you head? Say North or South. 	
alleyway_2a	reload	You can... say north, say south. 	
alleyway_2a	go-north	The lizardman heads south after Henry. From the look of things, you’re heading to Summerton Cemetery. 	nextscene_cemetery_5a
alleyway_2a	go-south	The lizardman is after you, so now it’s your job to keep them from getting to Birdie. Your instinct is to run towards the police station.  You run full force, too afraid to even look back. 	nextscene_police_station_6a
alleyway_2b	load	The alleyway is dark and deserted. As you pick yourself up off the ground, but as you do a loud crash can be heard behind you from the door to the bar which you were recently booted from.  The alleyway is a dead end to the west but opens to the main road to the east. From there if you head North you can try to stop by Birdie’s apartment. If you head South you can just head home. Which way do you head? Say North or South. 	
alleyway_2b	reload	You can... say north, say south. 	
alleyway_2b	go-north	You walk slowly to Birdie’s apartment nursing your wounds.  You get a few dirty looks from passersby as you walk up the steps to his fancy building. 	nextscene_birdie_apartment_7a
alleyway_2b	go-south	You get hopelessly lost in the city.  Your phone’s dead and you have become exhausted. A belligerent man wearing nothing but a top hat and a dirty pair of jeans starts yelling at you. You try to avoid him by crossing the street, but he disappears in a puff of smoke only to reappear right in front of you. You yell at him, “Get away!” Unfazed he shrieks “DOOM! The darkness had arrived. Only I can save you!!.”  He blows a handful of dust into your face and you feel yourself transforming.  Your body writhes in pain and you fall to your hands and knees.  As your body shrinks you feel your nose elongating.  You stare at your hands which have turned into tiny paws. The last feeling you have is an overwhelming desire for cheese.  	exec_endgame
