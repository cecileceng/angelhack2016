hotel_bar_1a	load	You are in a dimly lit hotel bar. It’s near closing time, so it’s empty aside from the bartender polishing the last of the glasses from the evening’s crowd. 	
hotel_bar_1a	reload	You can... examine bar, examine bartender, talk to bartender, attack bartender, examine glasses, pick up glasses, exit room. 	
hotel_bar_1a	examine-bar	It’s a typical hotel bar. The smell of cigarettes is pervasive and the tables and counters are sticky from spilled drinks. 	
hotel_bar_1a	examine-bartender	A tall gentleman stands behind the bar. His indifference towards you, his job and the world is very apparent as he stares blankly at nothing while wearing a permanent scowl on his face. 	
hotel_bar_1a	talk to-bartender	You approach the bartender. He eyes you suspiciously. You ask him if his name is Henry. He gruffly responds ‘Look pal, we’re about to close up shop here. I’m Henry, so what’s it to you?’ You tell him Birdie sent you, at which his eyes widen. He moves out from behind the bar to close the doors to the room, flipping the Open sign over to Closed. He pulls up  a barstool next to you. ‘I’ve known Birdie for a long time… never seen him like this. He was talking so fast I couldn’t barely understand what was happening. He kept saying ‘They’re after me.’ But when I asked who was after him he said ‘Not someone. SomeTHING.’ He told me he was going to meet you here, but then he got this look on his face like he realized something terrible. He left in a hurry though. He said something about leaving it with Lottie. Poor guy. His wife Lottie passed not too long ago. They buried her over at Summerton Cemetery. I would say he’s just grief stricken, but I’m still worried about him.’ The previously gruff looking bartender shows a soft side to him. But it doesn’t last. You hear screams from the lobby and suddenly the doors fly open. A towering figure enters the room, blood dripping off its hands. But something is strange. It’s in the shape of a man, but he has scales. Henry grabs you and starts pushing you out the backdoor. ‘We have to go find Birdie!’ You both run out the door but the lizardman is in pursuit. 	nextscene_alleyway_2a
hotel_bar_1a	attack-bartender	Attacking someone out of nowhere is hardly ever a good plan. The bartender is stronger than he looks and promptly beats you up. He drags you through the kitchen to the back and leaves you bloodied and crying. You also peed your pants. You can never return to the hotel bar. 	 nextscene_alleyway_2b
hotel_bar_1a	examine-glasses	They are just standard glasses. 	
hotel_bar_1a	pick up-glasses	The bartender glares at you when you place your hands upon the glass. If you need something just ask me, I’m right here, he says.
